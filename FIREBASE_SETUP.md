# Firebase Security Setup

## 🔒 **Current Secure Setup**

Your Firebase credentials are now properly secured:

### **✅ What's Protected:**
- **Credentials folder** is in `.gitignore` - won't be pushed to GitHub
- **JSON files** are in `.gitignore` - additional protection
- **Environment variables** approach documented for future use

### **📁 Current Structure:**
```
Stockly/
├── Credentials/           # ← IGNORED by Git
│   └── Firebase/
│       └── stockly-db-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-0441a05a82.json
├── .gitignore            # ← Protects credentials
└── FIREBASE_SETUP.md     # ← This documentation
```

### **🚀 Ready to Push:**
Your project is now safe to push to GitHub! The sensitive credentials file is excluded from version control.

## 🔄 **For Future Environment Variables (Optional)**

If you want to use environment variables instead of the file approach:

### **Step 1: Create .env file**
Create a `.env` file in your project root with your Firebase credentials.

### **Step 2: Install dotenv package**
```xml
<PackageReference Include="dotenv.net" Version="2.0.0" />
```

### **Step 3: Update FirebaseService**
Use the environment variables approach in the FirebaseService.

## ✅ **Security Benefits**

- ✅ **Credentials are not in version control**
- ✅ **Different credentials for different environments**
- ✅ **Secure deployment practices**
- ✅ **Easy to rotate credentials**
- ✅ **Ready for production deployment**

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Push to GitHub** - Your credentials are safe!
2. **Deploy to production** - Set environment variables on your hosting platform
3. **Add more users** - Create new documents in your Firebase console
