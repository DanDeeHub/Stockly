# Secure Credential Storage Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides secure storage of user credentials using local storage with AES encryption. The system supports both "Remember Me" functionality and session-based storage.

## Features

### 1. Encrypted Storage
- Uses AES encryption to secure stored credentials
- Encrypts both username and password before storing in local storage
- Automatic decryption when loading credentials

### 2. Remember Me Functionality
- Users can choose to remember their credentials
- Stored credentials are valid for 30 days
- Automatic cleanup of expired credentials

### 3. Session Storage
- Stores username only for session-based login
- Session data is valid for 24 hours
- Non-encrypted but limited scope

### 4. Security Features
- Automatic credential cleanup on logout
- Expiration-based credential validation
- Error handling with automatic cleanup on corruption

## Implementation Details

### SecureStorageService

The main service that handles all secure storage operations:

```csharp
// Save credentials with encryption
await SecureStorage.SaveCredentialsAsync(userId, username, password, rememberMe);

// Load saved credentials
var credentials = await SecureStorage.LoadCredentialsAsync();

// Clear all stored data
await SecureStorage.ClearAllStorageAsync();
```

### Storage Types

1. **Encrypted Credentials** (`stockly_credentials`)
   - Stores username and password encrypted with AES
   - Used when "Remember Me" is checked
   - Valid for 30 days

2. **Session Data** (`stockly_session`)
   - Stores username only (no password)
   - Used for session-based login
   - Valid for 24 hours

### Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important Security Notes:**

1. **Encryption Key**: The current implementation uses a hardcoded encryption key. In production:
   - Use environment variables for the encryption key
   - Consider using a secure key management service
   - Rotate keys regularly

2. **Local Storage Limitations**:
   - Local storage is not completely secure
   - Data can be accessed by JavaScript on the same domain
   - Consider additional security measures for highly sensitive applications

3. **Password Storage**:
   - This implementation stores passwords in plain text (encrypted)
   - For production, consider using refresh tokens instead of storing passwords
   - Implement proper password hashing on the server side

## Usage

### Login Page Integration

The Login page now includes:
- "Remember Me" checkbox
- Automatic loading of saved credentials
- Secure storage of credentials on successful login

### Logout Integration

The logout process now:
- Clears all stored credentials
- Removes session data
- Ensures clean state for next login

## Production Recommendations

1. **Use Environment Variables**:
   ```csharp
   _encryptionKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("STOCKLY_ENCRYPTION_KEY");
   ```

2. **Implement Refresh Tokens**:
   - Store refresh tokens instead of passwords
   - Use short-lived access tokens
   - Implement proper token rotation

3. **Add Additional Security**:
   - Implement device fingerprinting
   - Add IP-based restrictions
   - Use HTTPS-only storage

4. **Regular Security Audits**:
   - Review encryption implementation
   - Test for common vulnerabilities
   - Update security practices regularly

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Login with "Remember Me" checked
2. Close the browser and reopen
3. Navigate to the login page
4. Credentials should be automatically filled
5. Test logout to ensure credentials are cleared
